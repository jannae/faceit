### Course Description

**[Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/)**

In this all day workshop, we will examine the human face. We'll look at the differences between face detection and face recognition as well as demonstrate examples that implement blink detection, smile detection, and tracking the contours of the face. In addition, we'll look at some image processing techniques for face morphing. Examples will be demonstrated in Processing.
